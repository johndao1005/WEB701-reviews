# WEB701-Final Milestone

Improved on the prototype build for the MERN stack which I used React hooks to manage the state and data display on the webpage, for the final product, I used Redux for strong state management throughout the webpage. With Reduct, the information is managed and can only be updated through actions and depending on the result from API, the different states will be returned such as error, loading information or success message and in turn re-render the page. In order to work with Redux, we need to create actions which will be triggered by the user from the UI side then handle the change in data and return new information to the reducer which will store all the state and information of any outcome and the information then will be re-render on the user side. The logic is sounded but it could present some challenges for developers to jump in.

After some experience and testing, It is noted that there are some limitations with hooks such as if users already login into one tab of the web browser, if they open another tab on the same browser then they can log in again. This can cause a lot of issues with security, and data control so, in order to remove the problem, I need to use Redux to control the login state of the users. The same also applies to displaying products and items which will be rendered differently on a different tab. Moreover, from working with Firebase, I understand it would be ideal to have a snapshot system which can be used to check the data and return updated information every time an update occurs to the system.

Furthermore, I learned to split routers depending on different states so users can only access certain pages without login credentials, this method will decrease the time needed to handle putting up a router and navigation guard in case users try to hack through the webpage navigation link. It also requires Redux to work as it d for the user to edit the state without appropriate action. The technique also supports a cleaner route control which can be messy and frustrating as the application gets bigger and more complex.

Lastly, I also apply Ant design to improve the outlook as well as decrease the design time. The front-end framework comes with prebuilt components, style and icons which allows the design to be optimised. Customisation is also available to apply personal style or theme so the developer can change the colour as well as the behaviour of the element.  The framework could allow the web developer to speed up the process of designing but also could limit the option and require further work when it comes to customisation from the project manager or project owner.

In conclusion, the project helps me a lot with improving my skill in using React and gives me a better understanding of React eco-system. Due to the way the system is designed to utilise the email service to hand out tokens for claiming packages as well as sending beneficiary order confirmation so an interface for the beneficiary is not implemented as it is intended to reduce data on the database.
